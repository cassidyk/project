Project to help with using Docker.
Consists of the following scripts:
build.sh - Create a base /image from available scripts in /distro.
container.sh - Generate /volume template for container creation. Will attempt to avoid duplication
create.sh - Create containers based off /volume file. Assumes containers which exist are correct and will mount them
