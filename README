Project to help with using Docker.
Consists of the following scripts:
build.sh - Create a base /image from available scripts in /distro
mount.sh - Configure /node file to setup an /image with volume information
create.sh - Create containers based off /node file. Will assume any containers which exist share the correct volumes
